# 1. Introduction to Angular

## What is Angular?

**Angular** is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **TypeScript**. Developed and maintained by **Google**, Angular allows developers to create dynamic, scalable, and high-performance web applications using a **component-based architecture**.

It is a **front-end framework** that comes with built-in tools for routing, forms, HTTP requests, animations, testing, and more — all integrated into a cohesive development environment.

## How Does Angular Work?

Angular operates based on several core concepts:

### 1. **Component-Based Architecture**
- The UI is broken into **components**, which are self-contained units of logic and UI.
- Each component has an HTML template, TypeScript class, and optional CSS styles.

### 2. **Modules**
- Angular applications are organized into **NgModules**, which group related components, directives, and services.

### 3. **Data Binding**
- Angular supports multiple types of data binding:
  - **Interpolation** (`{{ value }}`)
  - **Property binding** (`[property]="value"`)
  - **Event binding** (`(event)="handler()"`)
  - **Two-way binding** (`[(ngModel)]="value"`)

### 4. **Dependency Injection**
- Services and dependencies are injected into components and other services automatically.

### 5. **Routing**
- Built-in router allows navigation between different views/components.

### 6. **Directives**
- Built-in or custom instructions in templates to modify DOM elements (e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`).

## History of Angular

| Version | Year Released | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| AngularJS (1.x) | 2010 | Original version using JavaScript |
| Angular 2 | 2016 | Complete rewrite in TypeScript |
| Angular 4 | 2017 | Skipped version 3 to align router version |
| Angular 5–10 | 2017–2020 | Incremental updates, better performance |
| Angular 11–14 | 2020–2022 | IVY renderer, stricter typing, standalone components |
| Angular 15–16 | 2022–2023 | Signals introduced, stable standalone APIs |
| Angular 17–19 | 2023–2025 | Deferred loading, improved SSR, zoneless apps support |

> ⚠️ Note: Angular (2+) is a complete rewrite and **not backward-compatible** with AngularJS (1.x).
